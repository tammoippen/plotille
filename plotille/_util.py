def roundeven(x):
    '''Round to next even integer number in case of `X.5`

    In Python3 this is the same as `round(x, 0)`, but since Python2 rounds up
    in that case and I want consistent behaviour, here is the roundeven function.

    Parameters:
        x: float  The number to round.

    Returns:
        int: floor(x)       if x - floor(x) < 0.5
             ceil(x)        if x - floor(x) > 0.5
             next even of x if x - floor(x) == 0.5

    if math.isinf(x) or math.isnan(x):
        return x  # same behaviour as in python2
    x_r = round(x)
    if abs(x_r - x) == 0.5:
        return int(2.0 * round(x / 2))

def hist(X, bins):  # noqa: N803
    '''Create histogram similar to `numpy.hist()`

    Parameters:
        X: List[float|datetime]  The items to count over.
        bins: int                The number of bins to put X entries in.

    Returns:
        (counts, bins):
            counts: List[int]  The counts for all bins.
            bins: List[float]  The range for each bin: bin `i` is in [bins[i], bins[i+1])
