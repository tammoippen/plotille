    ``[0.0, 1.0]`` interval.
    """

        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        vmin, vmax : float
            Normalize according to these values.

        clip : bool, default: False
            If ``True`` values falling outside the range ``[vmin, vmax]``,
            are mapped to 0 or 1, whichever is closer, and masked values are
            set to 1.  If ``False`` masked values remain masked.

            Clipping silently defeats the purpose of setting the over, under,
            and masked colors in a colormap, so it is likely to lead to
            surprises; therefore the default is ``clip=False``.

        Notes
        -----
        Returns 0 if ``vmin == vmax``.
